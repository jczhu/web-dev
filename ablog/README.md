###A Blog

Simple blog web app made for the course, problem set 3. Similar to asciichan

[link](http://ablog-1202.appspot.com/)

Above link is currently without signup and login stuff from pset 4. This is mostly because there are a lot of gaps in the class. I was unable to come up with a work around and it'll take some extensive Googling and reading their solution before I get it up. But the raw files (including me setting up the signup page) are currently on GitHub.
I just am not sure how they're checking if a user is already in the database. Will go read Google App Engine datastore API to get up to speed.
