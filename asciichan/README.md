###Simple ASCII art forum

Part of the learning databases lesson. User can add ASCII art (along with title) and it will be displayed below the form.
I initially added a Totoro and Calvin and Hobbes ASCII art (that I found off of Chris.com).

After Unit 5, added a static Google Map to practice APIs. Added a Yin/Yang art to test the map.

I was unable to get cache working for Unit 6 (for some reason didn't update even after clearing cache), so I didn't load that version onto the website. But the current code has caching (I made a mistake and didn't branch...thought it would work since I was copying what they did during the class, but it's not working)
